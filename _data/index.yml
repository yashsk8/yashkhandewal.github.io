                all the events at Technex. This event primarily tests the
                participants skills in drone making and flying. I, along with my
                team designed the problem statement for the event. We
                constructed the arena and organised the event which went on to
                become a grand success. Even now, the tradition of this event is
                continued and it remains the event with the highest stakes each
                year."
